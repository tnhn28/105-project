			<h4>Time</h4>
			<p>Most likely you'll need to commit a lot more time than you initially thought. But don't let that put you off - most of 
			   it is fun and not at all like work.</p>

			<h4>Attention</h4>
			<p>If you want to make rapid progress, you'll need to pay attention. Ain't no use coasting along on autopilot (i.e. half your mind 
			   is elsewhere while you just go through the motions). Albert Einstein said “It is not that I'm so smart. But I stay with the 
			   questions much longer.” </p>

			<h4>Slack</h4>
			<p>It's already been said many times before, but let me repeat it 'cos it's that important - the Slack Student Community is 
				your best friend, make a habit of just reading through it - it will save you a lot of problems, some of it even before 
				you encounter them. </p>

		<div class="half-width" id="practise">
			<h4>Practise</h4>
			<p>Well there's no nice way of putting this. Practise, practise and practise. “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, 
					involve me and I learn.” <br>― Benjamin Franklin</p>
