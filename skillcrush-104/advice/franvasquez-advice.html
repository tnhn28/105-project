			<p>Learning to code can be overwhelming and frustrating but I always try to follow the advice
			from experienced developers. The most useful tips to follow during our coding journey are:</p>
			<h4>1. Don't give up</h4>
			<p>Failure is key to success in web development. The path between your idea and the webpage you want
				to build is a series of problems that have to be solved, and very rarely are they solved on the first try.
				Even the best developers in the world regularly come across problems that require them to save, test, and
				debug repeatedly until they find the right solution. It's in this that we find new and more efficient ways
				to get things done.
			</p>
      <h4>2. Start Simple and Work Your Way Up</h4>
      <p>Consider starting with some beginning online courses that teach you the basics of HTML5 and CSS. This will
				get you where you need to be to start adding additional features to your work like incorporating PHP or
				JavaScript, and to do things like interact with a CMS.</p>
      <h4>3. Donâ€™t Be Afraid to Learn New Things</h4>
      <p>You will never stop learning as a developer. There will always be a new process or a new codebase that changes
				anything and everything you knew before. If you want to keep up you have to constantly be open to new ideas and
				new methods, and be willing to learn and try new things.</p>
			<h4> 4. Set Up Your Own Development Server and Play</h4>
			<p>Once you have your development server up, then you have a virtual sandbox to play in, break things, and try out
				new ideas with. Practice is the best learning tool a developer can have, and a local development server is perfect
				for this. Web development is a rewarding activity. It empowers you to create websites that are completely unique to
				your vision, and better prepares you for more advanced areas of programming.</p>
