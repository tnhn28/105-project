			<h4><span class="ericlahoda-code">coding</span> is like practicing<br> a musical intrument</h4>

<p>When you watch someone play an instrument, you may think, "I can do that if I just memorized
a bit of music and finger positions". However, as with playing an intrument, coding skill is built with practice and repetition. So repeat that code, again. When code flows, its like sweet music. :)</p>

			<h4>Mistakes are your friends</h4>
<p>It can be frusrating to not get the answers correct. But each attempt that you fail, you learn what can and cannot be done.</p>
<p>Plus those mistakes force you to practice again and again. See first advice above.</p>
