			<h4>If you do it wrong, try again. Rinse. Repeat!</h4>
			<p>One of the most difficult things about learning to code is that more often than not the syntax has to be precise! This can be especially frustrating when you are starting out. One tiny little typo can absolutely wreak havoc. You absolutely must pay close attention to every single command in the terminal, and every character of every line of code. </p>

			<p>Often when things look wrong, or just refuse to work, it's because of some incredibly minor oversight, so check your work, and then check your work again and again when things go sideways.</p>

			<p>On a related note... use a text editor that supports auto complete. It's hard to misspell ot forget to close a tag when your editor does it for you!</p>

			<h4>Google is your friend.</h4>
			<p>Seriously. If you have a question, chances are someone else has had exactly the same question... especially when it comes to using the command line. Or, you can always cut to the chase and go straight to stack overflow for code, and w3schools.com for anything related to HTML and CSS.</p>

			<p>There are SO many free tools on the internets these days... there's simply no excuse not to use them. I know because the first web page I created was in 1994, when there was literally nothing but man pages in the command line and very basic books on html. We coded in the snow. Both ways, uphill!</p>
