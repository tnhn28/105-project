			<h4>You are never too old to learn how to code!</h4>
			<p>When you start coding it's a little scary. You think you might not get it. You run into problems that you can't figure out at first. It gets better. You CAN learn this language, age is no barrier. Be persistant, breath and re-boot. The answers will come and they will come faster as time goes on.</p>

			<p>The first time I tried to code, I did okay but then let it go and did not finish anything. I didn't keep going. Then I woke up one day and said ENOUGH! I AM going to do this, I need this, I want this for myself. I want to keep learning.</p>

			<p>Three years older now than the first time, over 50 and proud to say that I am doing it. I made a website from scratch, yes, I did. I am learning! It's not always easy but help is a few key words in a search engine away. You CAN learn this challenge.</p>

			<p>So my advice is don't give up, keep going. You will look back on this time with pride and accomplishment however old you are. It's never too late to learn.</p>
