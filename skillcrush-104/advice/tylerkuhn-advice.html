            <h4>Never give up!</h4>
            <p>When you first start your coding journey, you are going to run into alot of problems. You just have to keep trying and checking your code, you'll get it eventually.</p>

            <p>You just have to remember you just started, and you dont know very much yet. Soon you will have no problme finding and fixing problems.</p>

            <h4>Be patient.</h4>
            <p>I have learned that everything that comes with learning a new skill takes time, you can't rush it or go around it.</p>
            <p>Just go at a pace that is comfortable for you, and when you dont understand something spend a little extra time on learning it.</p>
