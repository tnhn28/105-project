			<h4>Remember the Why</h4>
			<p>I've been there before. Your out of coffee, can barely keep your eyes open and yet you are so close to saving and calling it a day. Only one line of code stands in your way and you simply can not figure out what is going wrong. You serched the internet, consulted forums and guess and checked. You are damn near ready to give up, yet are still trying to figure it out. Its the determination behind the project that keeps us going. Sometimes we can forget what is driving us and slip into a routine of just living our lives by chance. <b>But not you skillcrusher.</b> You have the perserverance to learn and grow with every line. Whether its for your family, for yourself, or for your furry friend; keep the motivation fresh in your head and know one day, you will be there. Maybe not tomorrow, or next week because all good things take time. Each day you are learning and gaining more skills. Its helpful to even write those things down. That way, when you feel like you aren't getting anywhere. You can look back and remember not only the why, but feel confident in the process. You got this. </p>

			<h4>Never Give Up</h4>
			<p>There are, and still will be, countless times you've hit the wall and don't know where to go from here. Everything you've done, you feel is wrong, and you feel like its easier to start from scratch. Sometimes you will have to; but most times, the internet is a great resource to find helpful friends who will look at your project. Especially now that you know GitHub. Post it and see if anyone is able to help. There are countless resources out there to not only inspire you, but to help keep on going. Frustration is inevietable; but throwing in the towel is not an option. Never give up! Your future self will thank you.
