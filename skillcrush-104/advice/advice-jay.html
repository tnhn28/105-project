			<h4>Research is a Good Thing</h4>
			<p>As you go through your exercises, you will be asked to do certain tasks. Some will descibe how to do it in great detail and some will not. The ones that don't describe how to do it in great detail are the best ones!</p>

			<p>They are the best because they make you research! Research is half of what it takes to code. You will not remember how to do everything, and some things you will attempt for the first time as you are coding a project. Google how and try out the results. Play around. Ask questions. It is the best way to learn, and you will have great satisfaction when you figure out how to make it work.</p>
