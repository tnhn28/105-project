            <h4>Just Start</h4>
			<p>It won't be perfect, but it will be practice. (Hey, practice makes perfect!) No one emerges from the womb knowing how to code, so you just have to start somewhere and recognize that you'll make mistakes.</p>

			<h4>Be Kind to Yourself</h4>
			<p>If you feel like beating yourself up, stop and think about what you would say to a friend who was feeling discouraged. You deserve the same kindness.</p>
