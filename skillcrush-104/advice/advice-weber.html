		<h1>Hey, my name is Weber and I have some advice for you</h1>
	</header>
  <main>
			<h2>My advice for the newbies on Skillcrush*</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Go at the pace you need. I was determined to blow through Phase 1 in less than the time noted, but then my hard drive died and life got in the way.</li>
			<li>At the same time, don't stay away from progressing in the work for too long. If you wait too long, each time you come back you'll need to re-learn some of things you already went over.</li>
			<li>Admit when you're tired and probably coding poorly. Step away when really frustrated. A break is probably just what your brain needs.</li>
			<li>Find a quiet place to work. This might be at home, but it might be at a coffee shop, or in the library, or in that weird conference room at your day job where nobody wants to be so you get to have it all to yourself.</li>
			<li>Note: said quiet place may very well include headphones and your favorite jams.</li>
			<li>Keep at it. If a whole bunch of other Skillcrushers have crushed it already, we can too.</li>
			<li>If you've actually read this far, say hey! at jweber617 [@] gmail.com</li>
		</ul>
			<h3><small>*This is hilarious to me as I still consider myself a newbie.</small></h3>
