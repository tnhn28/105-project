			<h4>Welcome to your journey of constant learning!</h4>
			<p>It won't be easy at first. As you learn more, things will become second nature. Some concepts will come easily to you while others will leave you stumpped.</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help. Read a lot. Learn how to google for answers and decypher replies on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

			<h4>Keep track of your progress.</h4>
			<p>I highly recommend keeping a journal of some sort for your coding sessions. The format outlined in the <a href="http://www.100DaysOfCode.com" target="_blank">100 Days Of Code</a> challenge is a great template.</p>

			<p>Pay special attention to the things that are challenging for you. </p>

			<p>Look up additional documentation, practice problems, or explanations of those. Keep working to understand them and asking questions until you do.</p>

			<p>If you do track your progress you'll be amazed to look back on previous entries outlining concepts or techniques that baffled you a few short weeks or months before.</p>

			<h4>Just keep going!</h4>
			<p>Your life now consists of learning new things all the time. Don't be afraid of it. Everyone was new once.</p>
