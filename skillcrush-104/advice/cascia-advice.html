			<h4>Frustration is normal.</h4>
			<p>If this is brand new to you, don't fret if you find yourself getting frustrated.  This is almost like learning a foreign lanuage.  With practice it will come.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the best thing to do when you're feeling overly frustrated, is to just walk away for a few minutes.  Sit down with a clear head and try again.  It can really do the trick!</p>

			<h4>Go Slow.</h4>
			<p>Rushing leads to mistakes.  Mistakes that can be hard to pinpoint if you get too far ahead of yourself!  Slow down and write clean code.</p>
