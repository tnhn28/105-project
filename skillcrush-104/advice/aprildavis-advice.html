			<h4>Practice for fun.</h4>
			<p>I think it's awesome to do the exercises, but the learning can't stop there. Repetition is what solidifies your memory. So, bored? Code! Dream up a make-believe project. See if you can get it done. You'll surprise yourself with what you know.</p>

			<h4>You're going to get lost and confused, and that's okay!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, things don't go exactly as you think they will. Sometimes, you'll work a tutorial exactly the same way, but you'll get errors or unexpected results.<br />Awesome!!</p>

			<p>This is how you grow! Google the errors. Retrace your steps. ASK for help! Get it figured out. You won't forget the lesson. Promise.</p>
