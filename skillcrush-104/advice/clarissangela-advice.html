			<h4>Roadblocks are necessary</h4>
			<p>When you first start programming, remember that you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and a new experience that will allow you to learn and grow in ways you didn't think possible before.</p>

			<p>Hitting roadblocks is inevitable, but it's important that you trust the process. You're learning something new. Give yourself credit, and don't give up! If you need to take a break, take one. Come back when you're ready and keep moving forward. It takes time and patience, but you'll surely overcome these moments of frustration.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
