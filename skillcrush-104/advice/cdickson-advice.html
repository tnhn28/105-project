			<h4>It won't be perfect the first time.</h4>
			<p>Admit it.. You probably won't actually publish that first website you design. That's ok! The value is in learning the process. Once you have that process down (after a LOT of practice), then you will finally make that beautiful page you've been dreaming of.</p>

			<h4>Just get started!</h4>
			<p>Never underestimate the power of small steps taken consistently.</p>
