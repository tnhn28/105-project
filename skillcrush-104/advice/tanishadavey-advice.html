			<h4>Code until you can't code it wrong!</h4>
			<p>At the start of my coding journey, I was excited to be able to code something correctly, and then move onto the next lesson or project. However, that model does not build proficiency. If you are aiming for proficiency, you focus should be coding efficiently (a combination of speed and accuracy). Achieving this may mean coding the same code over and over again, timing yourself to see if you can do it faster, and with less errors than you did the previous time. It may mean coding the same HTML twenty times, and changing up the CSS style each time. The point is that you want to code often enough that concepts you have learned are so deeply rooted in your mind that it enables you to code with ease.</p>

			<p>Therefore, code it once. Code it twice. Code it as many times as you need until it feels like there is absolutely no way you can code it wrong.</p>

			<h4>Ask ALL of your questions.</h4>
			<p>One of the things that I've learend along the way is that developers, newbies and industry professionals alike, ask questions all the time... plenty of them. So don't be ashamed to ask those questions that you think may be too simple to ask &ldquo;out loud &rdquo; </p>

			<p>Also, in regards to asking questions, Google is your friend. When it comes to coding, there is an abundance of free resournces online. If you find that are you stuck, chances are you are not the first person to encounter the qeustion you may have. Try searching for your answer online.</p>

			<p>Feeling stuck, should not be an excuse for you to stop coding. If you have a questionn, keep coding even while you are searching for the answer. In some cases, you may be able to answer your own question as you continue working on the code.</p>
