			<h4>Practice as much as you can</h4>
			<p>When you start out, you are learning a new language. You remember how hard that was in high school. You need to practice as much as you possibly can, without burning yourself out of course.</p>

			<p>I thought doing the exercises in Skillcrush was going to be enough, but when it was time to do our first coding project, I was completely stumped.</p>

			<p>I wasn't able to do it without using all the resources and guides because I wasn't as familiar with everything as I thought. I needed more practice.</p>

			<p>Practice so much that you can do all this with your eyes closed.</p>

			<h4>Do not get discouraged</h4>
			<p>It can get overwhelming and feel like you are not making progress, but trust me, you are. You are getting better and better every time you practice.</p>

			<p>So don't stop or get discouraged. Do at least one thing everyday to help you with coding and to continue the forward momentum.</p>

			<p>And before you know it, you'll be doing it like a pro. And don't forget, you can always use Google.</p>
