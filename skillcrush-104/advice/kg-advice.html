			<h4>Boldly ask your questions!</h4>
			<p>Don't shy away from asking a question. I know it sounds cliche, but there really is no such thing as a dumb question when you're learning something new. Plus, it's the only way that you will learn and advance. So be bold and ask away!</p>

			<h4>In tech, even when you don't have it you still got this!</h4>
			<p>I remember feeling frustrated and, yes, even a little like an idiot when I struggled on certain lessons, or couldn't figure something out. But I soon learned that such is the nature of the tech field - you try and fail and fail again until you either get it, or make a whole new discovery. So don't get down on yourself. Even at times when you don't feel like you got this, you really do. Keep at it!</p>
