			<h4>Immersion is Key</h4>
			<p>When confronted by lines and lines of uniform code, just run your eyes over it and see if anything there is what you have learnt and how the bits seem to fall together, even if you don't really understand how.</p>

			<p>If they tell you it works believe them, just keep putting together the chunk-sized concepts you're learning to build up to something big!</p>

			<h4>Know When to Back of For a While</h4>
			<p>Learning is an highly active process.  Don't cram it all in.  Give your mind space to breath and absorb.</p>

			<p>When you are refreshed again, go back to the problem.  I am always able to resolve it after a break.
			</p>

			<p>When you work to see how all the pieces come together, you'll be satisfield with the results.</p>
