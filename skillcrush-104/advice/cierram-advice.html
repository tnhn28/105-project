			<h4>Confusion is normal.</h4>
			<p>Look at learning code like you would a new language. There are rules you've never heard of before, culture differences... And as you learn new things in tech (and even when you're well-versed in a tech topic), YOU WILL STILL EXPERIENCE CONFUSION! And it's okay!</p>

			<p>Confusionis a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="advice-two">
			<h4>Start NOW (and use the One Tab Chrome extension to speed up your computer).</h4>
			<p>Fear is an ugly thing, but it also can be turned around and made the fuel to your success if you push through.</p>

			<p>Everything seemed to have gotten in the way of me learning how to code over a year and a half ago, so I gave in. But now I'm ready and determined to work past any bumps in the road.</p>

			<p>It also helps that I found a way to speed up my computer: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en">One Tab Chrome extension</a>! A lifesaver.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="advice-three">
			<h4>Google is your best friend!</h4>
			<p>It feels weird when you're constantly looking up answers--like you <em>should<em> know more than you do. But it's <strong>VERY</strong> common to need to research answers. Embrace it!</p>
