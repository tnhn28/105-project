			<p>I'm probably going to do something a bit different than other students. It won't be about coding specifically. You're here because you want to explore a new career path, or, like me, you know some of the things you don't know and want to fill those gaps. That's a given. This is, however, real talk.</p>

			<h4>Don't work where you aren't appreciated.</h4>
			<p>This should be a no-brainer, but most of us need an income to survive- and that leads to doing stupid things, like working in an environment where your skills or what you work on are unknown to others or ignored (willfully or otherwise).</p>

			<p>Don't stick around longer than you have to. There are places that will want or need what you have to offer, and where you will be appreciated. It may not be easy, but find them, and figure out how to get in.</p>

			<h4>Do you ever think about when you outta here?</h4>
			<p>Have a plan. If there is one thing anyone takes away from this it should be those words: Have a plan. At all times.</p>

			<p>Assess your skills. Know your worth. Every time you do or accomplish something new, figure out if it's something worth including in your resume or LinkedIn profile and, if it is, do it as soon as possible. Should you find yourself unemployed, you need to assess yourself quickly, and find a way to address weaknesses in your skillset or add new skills with the least amount of time and money spent as possible.</p>
