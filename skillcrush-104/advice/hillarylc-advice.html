			<h2>Be kind to yourself!</h2>
			<p>When I started programming I really wanted to know everything, and know it yesterday! I'd get upset if I made a mistake, or forgot how to do something.</p>

			<p>I had to constantly remind myself that everything was okay! I had just started learning, and I shouldn't expect to be perfect. I hope you remember that too. Learning a new skill might be difficult and frustrating in the day-to-day, but in 1 month, 6 months or 12 months you will be so much farther than you ever imagined. So stick with it, trust the process, and remember that you <span>can</span> do it!</p>
