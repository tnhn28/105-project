			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new <em><strong>challenge</strong></em>, a new <strong><em>opportunity</em></strong>, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
		    <h4>Google is your best friend!</h4>
            <p>If you are stuck, just ask google the right question and there is always an answer! It's totally normal to consult the google, experienced software developers DO that.</p>
            <h4>Perseverance and motivation</h4>
            <p>Get focused on success. Never give up, be always motivated and remember you are going to reach the goal you have set: stick to your plans, keep working towards your goals and reach them!</p>
            <h4>Just start coding</h4>
            <p>As a begginner programmer you don't feel well prepared to start working on a real projects, you keep on learning and improving your technical backgrounds, but as a software developer you are going to learn constantly during your career and the best way to do it is practicing - so JUST START coding.</p>
