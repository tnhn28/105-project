			<h3>Understanding when you can code to become the Web Dev your know you Are!</h3>
			<p>As of now, you may have already learned a lot or not so much. When it comes to the art of learning to code, let's face it, it can be really hard at times, and can even push us away from making it a consistent habit within our daily lives. I know for me, coding has been the most fun and the most stressful, and could almost say I have a love - hate relationship with it. Though, through my 3 year journey of confusion, frustations, and celebrations, I've realized what's needed in order to fully get a grasp of how my coding skills, and what I had to do so I could finally feel confident in becoming a web developer.</p>

			<p>What was needed was knowing when and where I was going to commit,<--heh git jokes, my time to coding. If you're not making any time in a day for whatever skill that you want to learn, then it's time to check your priorities, I know had to. From my main job, friends & family, and any other events in between, I was feeling slightly overwhelmed that my idea of coding and creating awesome-amazing-websites for people wasn't going to come to fruition. That is until I listed out my hours in my typical day, and found that there a spots in my day that I could devote to coding.</p>

			<ul> <p>My hours in a day - before coding:</p>
			  <li>1 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>2 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>3 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>4 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>5 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>6 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>7 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>8 am: working</li>
			  <li>9 am: working</li>
			  <li>10 am: working</li>
			  <li>11 am: working</li>
			  <li>12 pm: working</li>
			  <li>1 pm: working</li>
			  <li>2 pm: working</li>
			  <li>3 pm: working</li>
			  <li>4 pm: working</li>
			  <li>5 pm: working</li>
			  <li>6 pm: working</li>
			  <li>7 pm: friends & family</li>
			  <li>8 pm: friends & family</li>
			  <li>9 pm: friends & family</li>
			  <li>10 pm: friends & family</li>
			  <li>11 pm: friends & family</li>
			  <li>12 am: start sleeping</li>
			</ul>

			<ul> <p>My hours in a day - After being serious about coding:</p>
			  <li>1 am: sleeping</li>
			  <li>2 am: coding</li>
			  <li>3 am: coding</li>
			  <li>4 am: coding</li>
			  <li>5 am: coding</li>
			  <li>6 am: coding</li>
			  <li>7 am: coding</li>
			  <li>8 am: working</li>
			  <li>9 am: working</li>
			  <li>10 am: working</li>
			  <li>11 am: working</li>
			  <li>12 pm: working</li>
			  <li>1 pm: working</li>
			  <li>2 pm: working</li>
			  <li>3 pm: working</li>
			  <li>4 pm: working</li>
			  <li>5 pm: working</li>
			  <li>6 pm: working</li>
			  <li>7 pm: start of sleeping</li>
			  <li>8 pm: sleeping</li>
			  <li>9 pm: sleeping</li>
			  <li>10 pm: sleeping</li>
			  <li>11 pm: sleeping</li>
			  <li>12 am: sleeping</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now my schedule may be a bit...extreme? But I assure you don't have to take after my schedule, I just want to devote so much time to making this an actual reality for me. Sometimes we have to cut the exess out of our lives for a short period of time in order to build ourselves and our abilities. One of the questions that would keep coming back to me when thinking about my daily priorities is: "what is the one "force multiplier" or one major task with the most leverage on my life that would make major differences if I give my time to take action on it?" The path of coding was/is my force multiplier. </p>

			<ol>
			  <p>How you can apply this:</p>
			  <li>List out what you do daily</li>
			  <li>List out what your priorities</li>
			  <li>Choose from both your lists what are the Major priorities with the most leverage in your life and is your "force multiplier"</li>
			  <li>Then, when will you dedicate and devote your time to that task. I suggest either real late evenings or, be cool like me, real early mornings.</li>
			  <li>Commit yourself to this new schedule and do it with another person to keep yourself accountable.</li>
			</ol>
