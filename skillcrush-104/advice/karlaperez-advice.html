			<h4>Imposter Syndrome</h4>

			<p>When you start learning to code there is a good chance you will feel like you're not qualified. You might feel like an 'imposter'. The good news? This is absolute bogus! Just because you didn't go to a traditional school to learn web design or you are making a complete career overhaul
				does not mean that you don't belong in the tech world. If you know how to do the work, you have earned that title. Be proud and repeat after me: <strong>"I AM A WEB DESIGNER!!"</strong> </p>

			<h4>What the f**k does that mean??</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning to code, no matter what language it is, there will be PLENTY that will look like complete giberish. Actually, most if it will probably look like giberish. Do not fret! This is normal! You are literally learning a new language. You must be patient and you must practice and read all the code even if you might not understand every bit of it. You need to get used to the way things flow and trust me, it will become second nature.</p>
