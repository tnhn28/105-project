			<h4>Connect with real people</h4>
			<p>It's so easy to just sit there in your own little world and code away, get stuck, feel unsure and just give up. Connect with other people, you are not alone on your coding journey. Go to <span class="bold">Office Hours</span> or <span class="bold">Feedback sessions</span>. Talk to people on Slack, connect with your career counseler. Meet real people, not just laptop screens.</p>

		<div class="blocks" id="second">
			<h4>Just start somewhere</h4>
			<p>The challenge just looks so overwhelming and there's divs and p's and paddings and margins and ohgodIdon't-understand-moments. Take a deep breath. And then just start in one corner. Start with something, set the background color, choose a picture or write class names, that's easy! <strong>Just start â€“ and then keep going.</strong></p>

			<h4>Find your why</h4>
			<p>Your day is mayhem, there's meetings, kids that break down, cry or throw tantrums, partners with migraine and lost wallets. So at the end of the day, what really matters is WHY you are doing this. <span class="bold">WHY do you want to learn to code?</span> For your crying child so that he or she grows up with a better future? For your partner so that he or she doesn't have to work ungodly long hours? For you?</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Find your why and sit down with your laptop, take the time, do the work, put in the effort. Do it.</span></p>
