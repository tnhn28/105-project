			<h4>Be bold and never give up!</h4>
			<p>Coding takes a certain amount of courage and a great deal of tenacity. You need to be able to keep going despite errors (and there will be many) and not be afraid to try new things.</p>

			<p>Think like a scientist and don't be afraid.</p>

			<h4>The answers are out there.</h4>
			<p>If you do come across something you've not done before, do not worry. It is highly unlikely that no one else has encountered that problem and in cases like this, Google is your friend.</p>

			<p>Coding is also a highly collaborative process so you will always be able to secure help, when needed.</p>

			<p>Someone in the world will always be free and willing to look at your code and help you out.</p>
