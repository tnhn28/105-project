			<h4>Believe in yourself!</h4>
			<p><em>Yes</em>, you are a newbie, but guess what? We've all been there. Just know that those who persist stop being newbies at some point and become experts eventually.</p>

<p>You can too! But first, you have to get pass the 5 stages of grief.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Denial</strong> - I am <em>NOT</em> a newbie. Newbies don't even know the difference between ul and ol and I DO!</li>

<li><strong>Anger</strong> - <em>WHYYYYY!!!??? Why</em> am I such a newbie?</li>

<li><strong>Bargaining</strong> - Maybe if I make a list of all the things I know, I will <em>prove</em> to everyone I am not a newbie.</li>

<li><strong>Depression</strong> - I am the newest of newbies, and I will <em>never</em> not be.</li>

<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> - I am a newbie, and <em>that is ok</em>. I will be less of a newbie everyday.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>That wasn't so bad, was it?</em></p>

<p>Now that that part is over, you can focus on the learning, having fun while doing so, and getting a good night sleep because that is when your brain will process the information you learned throughout the day!</p>

<p>Sleep is very important, but most importantly, you have to believe in yourself. Learning a new skill is never easy, if it were, it wouldn't be learning. You have to create those new paths on your brain! So give yourself a break and just keep at it! You'll get there eventually.</p>

<h4>DON'T STOP! Believin'!</h4> <p>Trust the process and trust yourself! You can do anything you set your mind to!</p>

<p>So, press play on this video, listen carefully to this song <em>(I play it everytime I need some extra motivation to accomplish a task)</em> and keep on fightin' because you are stronger than you think!</p>
