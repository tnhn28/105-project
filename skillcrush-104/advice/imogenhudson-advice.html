			<h4>Don't be intimidated by challenges early on!</h4>
			<p>When you are tackling projects like 'The Holstee Manifesto' it can be easy to feel that there is an overwhelming amount to learn, and lots of stumbling blocks! However, what's great is how much you will learn from this! Tackling those kinds of projects is equipping you really well for future projects, and the time and effort invested will pay off later on! </p>

			<h4>Things will fall into place-honestly!</h4>
			<p>There will certainly be times when you'll feel uncomfortable, because (if you're anything like me!) you will have watched the video three times, read over the guidelines countless times, and completed the task at hand successfully, only to realise you're still not quite sure how you got there, and why you did the things you did to get there. However, once you've practised this same process a few more times (which there will be plenty of opportunities for!), you'll start to have some 'aha' moments, where things you have previously done (without fully understanding them!) will suddenly become far clearer. As a result, you'll start to have more faith in your ability to learn, and better acceptance of the fact that feeling confused at times is simply a natural part of the learning process!</p>
