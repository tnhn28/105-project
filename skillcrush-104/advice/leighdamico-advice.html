			<h4>Confusion is your friend! <br> (Especially about the CSS Box Model)</h4>
			<p>Don't forget about your Developer Tools.  Use them to explore what's really going on with those pesky margins and paddings.</p>

			<h4>Don't rush!</h4>
			<p>Take your time in each lesson.  Don't be in so big of a hurry to finish that you don't take the time to understand every step.</p>
			<p>This is especially important when working with Git and GitHub</p>
