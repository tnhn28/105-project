			<h4>It is HARD, but don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Keep in minde that everytime we do something new, it's hard at first... and if it was easy, everybody would be doing it, right?
				Just hang on until it becomes easier, and if you're like me, you will love it so much that you won't be able to stop! =)</p>

			<h4>Solving your coding problems is soooooo gratifying!</h4>
			<p>The first time I had a problem (which comes pretty fast when you're learning), I was a bit discouraged.
				I almost went straight to get the solution, but I remembered what my husband told me: "Google can show you the path".
				So, instead, I searched, tried, failed, tried again and finally resolved by problem on my own. I was feeling awesome!!</p>
