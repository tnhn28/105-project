			<h2> My name is <span> Arshia</span> and I have a few words of advice...</h2>

			<h3>1. Failure will become your <span>BFF</span>!</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Get accustomed to the idea of failing often. It will be uncomfortable and frustrating, but eventually you will come to embrace it and recognize it as your tool for growth.</p></li>
			<li><p>Rest assured that if you keep at it, you will eventually come to the solution and feel like a freaking ninja!</p></li>
			</ul>


			<h3>2. Your <span>support network</span> is your everything!</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><p>The coding community is SUPER supportive. Get to networking like crazy!</p></li>
			<li><p>Do not be afraid to ask for help when you get stuck. Nobody is judging - in fact it's an opportunity for someone who was once where you are to pay it forward.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Whatever you do, absolutely <span>do not</span> give up!</h4>

			<ul>
			<li><p> You will want to so many times - even within a single day. But DON'T.</p></li>
			<li><p> Take a break, go for a walk, scream into a pillow, power pose in front of a mirror, or come back to it the next day - whatever it is you need to do to keep going.</p></li>
			<li><p> Bask in your bravery for even pursuing this and keep forging ahead like the bad ass coding warrior you are!</p></li>
			<ul>
