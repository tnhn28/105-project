			<h4>Never give up!</h4>
			<p>I started my Skillcrush BluePrint in late 2016, and let's just say a lot has changed in that time. Sometimes life is busy and you have to pause, but never give up! THe great thing about Skillcrush is that unlike traditional university programs, you can go at the pace your life allows. Going forward slowly is still going forward! </p>

			<h4>Ask for help. </h4>
			<p>Nothing is accomplished without collaberation. Ask the instructors for help early so you don't rage quit over a missed dash or dot or other syntax error. Also, you will need the people in your life to understand that you have made a commitment to yourself and to respect your commitment. Whenever you set out to do something big, you find that you have to reevaliate the roles some folks play in your life. That's normal, change is normal, and you will get through it. </p>


			<h4>Love yourself.</h4>

			<p>Self-care is a must. "You can't pour from an empty cup."</p>

			<h4>Best luck to you!!!!</h4>
