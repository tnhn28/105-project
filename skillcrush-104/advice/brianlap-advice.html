			<blockquote>Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. - Ralph Johnson</blockquote>
			<blockquote>When somebody begins a sentence with “IT WOULD BE NICE IF..” the right thing to do is to wait politely for the speaker to finish. No project ever gets around to the it-would-be-nice features: or if they do, they regret it. Wait for sentences that begin “WE HAVE TO..” and pay close attention, and see if you agree. - Tom Van Vleck</blockquote>

			<blockquote>Only half of programming is coding. The other 90% is debugging. -Unknown</blockquote>

			<blockquote>In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different -Coco Chanel</blockquote>

			<blockquote>Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers. -Voltaire</blockquote>
