           <h4>Keep motivated</h4>
           <p>It's important to celebrate your victories (even tiny ones) to reward new behaviour. Remember that euphoric moment when finally, after two days of searching, you find out what was wrong with your code and you can fix it and make it work? You GENIUS, you! That's what it's about. Keep trying, practice makes perfect. </p>
           
           <p>When you are stuck, google it. Chances are the awnser is out there. Furthermore: apparently somebody else had that issue too, and even felt it was worth making a post about. That means many other people also had that issue! So many people, just like you, get stuck all the time. You are not stupid, you are LEARNING. How nice other folks are learning too.</p>
           
           <h4>Make notes</h4>
           <p>You are learning so many new things, it might be a good idea to keep a notebook. On paper or digital , all good. Personally I love writing things down, it helps information embed in my brain better. But I also have a digital list with handy links and descriptions of how-to's I used to solve former problems. When you get that 'oh yeah, I've run into this issue before'-feeling you can easily look it up in your list and FIX IT. </p>
           
			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
