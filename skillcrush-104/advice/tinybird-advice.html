			<h4>Discipline is fun</h4>
			<p>"Fun" usually isn't a word associated with discipline, but they're really one and the same. Any time you set a goal (any goal!), a number of steps are required to get there. When the execution is aligned with what you envisioned, the whole process is enjoyable and satisfying. This alignment requires a certain level of what is commonly called discipline.</p>

			<p>Of course unexpected things pop up from time to time, but when your vision and reality are consistently out of whack you can begin to feel not-so-great. Planning to work at the same time every day and never sticking to your schedule is one example - doesn't feel so great, huh?</p>

			<p>Now, the caveat is when you set a goal for yourself that isn't actually in line with your true self. For example: pursuing a career that your parents expect from you, rather than one you're passionate about. In this case, discipline becomes a chore and suddenly turns into hard work.</p>

			<p>All of this is especially true given that coding in general (and this course specifically) is fairly self-motivated learning. If you're feeling stuck, evaluate the reasons why you're pursuing this (hint: money alone probably won't be enough of a reason!) and find your "Why". Show the love and respect for yourself needed to achieve your dreams, and you'll find the process to be both fun and rewarding!</p>
