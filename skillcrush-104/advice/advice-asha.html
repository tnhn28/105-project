			<h4>You Don't Need to be an Expert to Code</h4>
			<p class="advice">Coming from a medical background, I approached programming/coding all wrong. I kept feeling frustrated because I thought that everybody in the profession knew all the tags, attributes, elements, functions, etc by heart! I kept feeling like all the education I  received was holding out on me because I was only given what felt like basic info. I thought it was considered cheating to use a library! Now I understand that programmers are people who use libraries and a basic knowledge of a language to solve problems...and of course the more you use it, the better you get. </p>
