			<h4>Expect the Unexpected.</h4>
			<p>So you're like, a <em>really</em> good problem solver and pretty darn technically savvy... Everyone and their mom seems to be coding these days, you should just do it! Basic HTML &amp; CSS are a breeze and you're really enjoying the challenge!</p>

			<p>And then you begin working with floats. Suddenly you're doubting every decision you've ever made in your life that lead up to deciding to <em>stupidly</em> teach yourself how to be a web developer.</p>
            
            <p>Coding is hard sometimes; but, then again, so is life. So with coding, just as in life, always be prepared for the unexpected. Sure, you may spend today face-planted on your desk, but hey... You really enjoy the challenge ;)!</p>

			<h4>Believe in Yourself.</h4>
			<p>Okay but really, while you inevitably <em>will</em> spend some days facedown and out, this is a <strong>completely normal</strong> part of the process. The important part is taking the time to process and getting back at it!</p>

			<p>We do learn best by failure, after all. So don't be afraid o fail a lot and know that it's part of a deeper, more thorough learning process. Believe in those failures, believe in yourself.</p>
