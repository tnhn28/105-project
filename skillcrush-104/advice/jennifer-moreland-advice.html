			<h4>A few things I've learned so far...</h4>
			<p>When you first begin to code, be patient with yourself and take your time. <br>Learning to code is much easier to absorb when you really take the time to learn it.</p>

			<p>Take excellent notes, stay organized, and always make time to PRACTICE.</p>

			<p>Try and figure out a coding problem on your own first - this is helpful in learning from your mistakes. <br>But, don't be afraid to ask for help if you're at your wit's end!</p>
			<p>Learn from others and find people in the field that you admire.</p>

			<p>Never underestimate your potential and ability to be an amazing coder.</p>

			<p>When you begin your professional coding journey, find a mentor, stay present in your coding community, and continue to learn!</p>
