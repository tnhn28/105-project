			<h4>Code everyday!</h4>
			<p>Even if all you can do is five minutes a day - do it!  Practice, practice and more practice doesn't make you perfect, it gives you the confidence to tackle anything that will come up and something always comes up!.</p>

			<p>If you don't have the time to sit down at your computer, you can download apps to your phone and code while on the move.  I use <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="blank">Solo Learn</a> and they have everything from HTML to PHP and much more.</p>

			<h4>Google and the interweb is your friend</h4>
			<p>Whenever you run into a problem or you forget a bit of code, ask Google!  It's a guarantee that someone else has encountered the same problem you have - don't reinvent the wheel!</p>

			<h4>You don't have to learn everything</h4>
			<p>HTML, CSS, Java, C++, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, Ruby, Python, React, Angular...and more!  There are a lot of programs out there, but you don't have to learn everything.  You'll eventually start to prefer some over others - focus on those.</p>

			<h4>It's OK to take a break</h4>
			<p>It's important to step away from the screen sometimes!  Go outside, talk to humans, eat some chocolate - the code will still be there when you get back.</p>
