			<h4>Start with what you know...</h4>
			<p> The most important lesson for me has been to embrace challenges. </p>
			<p> When things don't work it's an opportunity to learn.</p>
			<p> At that moment I need to breathe deep, stop the panic inside </p>
			<p> and the voices that tell me that I can't do this.. <p>
			<p> I just start with what I know and do that. </p>
			<p> Then I do the next things I know and soon enough...</p>
			<p> I have built something!</p> <br>
