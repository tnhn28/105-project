			<h4>Don't Be A Perfectionist!</h4>
			<p>You don't have to master every thing now. Stick to you schedule and keep moving forward.  It doesn't have to be perfect.</p>

			<h4>Always Take Your Reading Glasses!</h4>
			<p>Changing your environment occasionally is helpful for increased productivity.  (At least me!)</p>

			<p>And ALWAYS check to make sure you have your reading glasses!!!</p>
