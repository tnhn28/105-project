			<h3>Enjoy your work!</h3>
			<p>Anything that you enjoy doing, you're going to do better. Put your personality into your work and make it something that you're proud of!</p>
			
			<h3>Keep it cool...</h3>
			<p>It's so much easier to write code when you've got a positive frame of mind. If you feel frustrated or stuck, it's okay if you take a break!<br>
			<br> Most of the time, the answer will come to you when you've stopped thinking about it. </p>
			 
			<h3>Google is your friend; developers are your family. </h3>
			<p>One can hardly be expected to remember everything. Remember the things that you need to use most often, and for most everything else, there's Google. <br>
			 <br>
			 If you find that your quesiton is so obscure or specific that you would rather talk to someone about it, ask! Developers love answering questions for those looking to hone their craft.</p>
			
			<h3>Don't worry, you've got this!</h3>
			<p>I'd be lying if I said it was easy all the time. Just don't give up, and you'll always find the answers you're looking for.</p>
