			<h4>You're not supposed to know it all!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, chances are you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a whole new world out there, and it's easy to get overwhelmed by how much you DON'T know. Don't let that stop you from starting.</p>

			<p>Each and every new skill you learn will involve equal parts wonder and confusion. Not knowing why or how exactly things are happening is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. Frustrating as it may be, it's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving process- it's time for you to embrace your inner Shaun T and Dig Deeper because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Programming languages are just like any foreign language.</h4>
			<p>Did you take French or Spanish (or any other language) in high school? Remember all the vocabulary and grammar you learned? Instead of thinking of a programming language as hyper challenging tech, attack it the same way you would any other language- learn the vocabulary and how it all fits together.</p>

			<p>Just like Spanish or French or Italian, the only way to truly learn is to immerse yourself in it.</p>
