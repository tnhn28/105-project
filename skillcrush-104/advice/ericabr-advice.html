			<h4>Starting My SkillCrush Journey</h4>
			<p>As of now, I cannot think of anything "I wished someone had told me when I started." I feel like the materials Skillcrush provided have prepared me thus far. </p>

			<p>I am very proud of myself because I feel like I have accomplished alot. I would have never imagined even two months ago that I would have designed, coded, and launched my own website. I am very excited to continue this journey.</p>
