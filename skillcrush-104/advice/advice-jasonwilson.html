			<h4>Take your time and enjoy the journey</h4>
			<p>Beginning to learn a new skillset can feel like a daunting, almost overwhelming task. The important thing is to trust in what you are doing and to believe in yourself. You are bettering yourself and that is always a good thing! </p>

			<p>Know that most things worth value in life generally take time and energy. They mean more to us if we exert effort in obtaining them. So don't rush the process and be sure to give yourself time to absorb the lessons along the way. This will help you learn more, retain more, and most importantly enjoy what you are learning. </p>

			<h4>Repetition breeds confidence, proficiency, and success</h4>
			<p>It's important to continue using newly learned lessons. It will allow you to hone what you've learned so that it becomes reactionary as well as the ability to execute tasks faster and with more expertise. You will gain more, whether it be monetarily or simply with your time.</p>
