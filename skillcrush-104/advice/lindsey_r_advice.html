			<h4>Perfection is your Frenemy</h4>
			<p>Stop obsessing over your portfolio design! You are inevitably going to redesign it again when you finish Skillcrush and have improved your skills. Do a "good enough job" and move on!</p>

			<p>Try to help someone on Google Groups--even if you feel like an idiot and don't really know what you are talking about.  It will encourage other people to participate and more feedback is better than none.</p>

			<h4>Practice and Forgiveness</h4>
			<p>Skillcrush is just a starting point. It can only give you a small taste of Photoshop, CSS, Github, etc. Seek out additional resources so you can keep building those skills.</p>

			<p>It's easy to get off track--especially if you have attention-sucking children in your house. Forgive yourself when you get off track, but don't derail. Keep going at whatever pace you can manage.</p>
