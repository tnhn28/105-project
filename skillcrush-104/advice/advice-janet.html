			<h4>Be Open to Being a Total Beginner!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It might be odd to do something that you are not good at. It's hard to start from the start. But it's okay. Let go of the fear and make errors left and right. The mistakes are what will help you learn. And it's what will make you love developing even more when you figure out how to fix it all by yourself!</p>
