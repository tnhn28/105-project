			<p>You had an interest in acquiring more knowledge on the subject of coding & design.  You then took time to research, explored resources & found your way to <span class= "skillcrush">Skillcrush!!</span> Hooray! You may not have realized it, but, those innate & instinctual qualities to seek answers... Well, those qualities are assets & they're exactly what you need in <span class="wd">Web Design & Web Development.</span></p>

			<p>Aside from creating beautiful designs, you’ll also be figuring out how to write the code to apply that beauty & build up amazing websites.

You <strong>WILL</strong> be able to identify & fix every problem you encounter because of your ability to be resourceful & tenacious. These two qualities alone will be necessary since you’re problem-solving 100% of the time.</p>

			<h4 id="transcending">Transcending Trepidation & Claiming Your Rightful Spot.</h4>
			<p>I too possessed a great deal of apprehension before I enrolled in <span class="skillcrush">Skillcrush’s</span> <span class="bitbp">Break Into Tech Blueprint</span> in October of 2017. It’s frightening to embark on something new. However, I’m proof, those fears can be assuaged over time through dedicating scheduled time for learning & attending office hours. In addition, it’s important to factor in revision time, & something I like to call, <span class="pp">“practical playing.”</span> Yes, you read that correctly! When work feels like play & it makes your heart sing - - these moments are just confirmation that you’re exactly where you need to be & doing what you’re meant to do!  </p>

			<p>Before you know it, you’ll be able to easily spot issues & correct them without looking up values & properties every two seconds.  Your confidence will grow because you’re now trusting yourself & believing in your technological abilities. When you put in the work, you most definitely reap rewards! I’m currently taking my 3rd class (of the year-long <span class="bitbp">Break Into Tech Blueprint</span> & I love every single nanosecond of it! Yup, I’m even including the hard stuff.</p>

			<h4 id="journey">Advice for the Journey Ahead:</h4>
			<p>Through this journey, I am learning every day, not just about design & code; but invaluable life-lessons. So this is the advice I wanted to share with you… </p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="share">You’re not in competition with anyone else.</span> So, don’t put unnecessary pressure on yourself.  If you take longer to complete a lesson, so be it. It’s okay to go at your own pace. It’s better to take your time & actually understand what you've learned, instead of working to get through. You’ll need to truly comprehend everything in order to move forward, not just in your lessons; but in your career. Also, did you know you can utilize your technological skills & transfer them to basically any other field? Yup, it's true!<br> <span class="quote">"Whatever you’re passionate about, your technology skills are translatable & applicable.- - Kaya Thomas, Engineer"</span> These skills are indispensable!</li>
				<li><span class="share">When you can’t figure something out...</span> You may grow frustrated, cry real tears, or think you’re not smart enough. <strong>STEP AWAY!</strong> Do something to take your mind off of it, when you revisit your work, you’ll have a renewed focus, a cleared mind & can channel the positive energy; you’ll find you’ll be able to solve your issue(s).</li>
				<li><span class="share">Get out of your own way!</span> If you find you cannot solve the issue(s) independently, ask for help! Guess what? There is absolutely no shame in reaching out to your Instructor(s) for help.   You’re learning, so remember to be gentle with yourself. Besides, the <span class="skillcrush">Skillcrush Instructors</span> are <strong>AWESOME!</strong> They give you the some serious gems/keys/tools to help you work through your problems.  Moreover, Instructors have inside knowledge of what you’re experiencing because they’ve once been in the place you’re at now.</li>
			</ol>
				<p>So, after reading all of the above, I hope you're <strong><em>finally</em></strong> realizing you have exactly what it takes to do this!  Oh, yeah, just in case you were wondering... You’re <strong><em>also</em></strong> a member of the aforementioned <em>“exclusive technology realm,”</em> You were inducted the day you decided to enroll in your 1st <span class="bitbp">Blueprint!</span> This is such a loving & accepting community where you’re given the tools to be the best, because you’re deserving! Can’t wait to connect & collaborate with you somewhere on the internet! So good luck & sending you positive vibes for writing clean code & creating delectable design!</p>
