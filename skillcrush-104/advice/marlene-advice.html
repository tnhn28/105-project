			<h2>You can do it!</h2>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's definitely a challenge and sometimes you feel like it is too difficult.</p>

			<p>The trick is not to give up.  You must keep trying and eventually it will make sense.
			<h2>Repetition</h2>
			<p>Doing it over and over is an important part to gaining an understanding.
			<p>Practice new and different things until you are comfortable.  Push yourself.
			<p>Don't give up.</p>
