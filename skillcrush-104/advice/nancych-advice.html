			<h4>Focus on One Track for a while!</h4>
			<p>It's easy to get bogged down trying to learn everything at once.  Just focus on one area for a while until you feel somewhat comfortable.  Keep your interest high with reading blogs and articles on various questions that interest you.</p>

			<h4>It's all been done before.</h4>
			<p>Google is your friend! If you're stuck on something, chances are that someone else has had the same problem. But do test it out and see if the answer you find makes sense. And don't get discouraged.  It'll all start to come together as you go.</p>
