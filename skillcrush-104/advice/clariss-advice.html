			<h4>1. Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>2. It gets better.</h4>
			<p>Even though it seems confusing at first -- and it's going to seem confusing at first; it's a new language! -- it will get easier. You just have to take it one step at a time. You didn't learn to read or write or speak fluent English right away, did you? Of course not! It took consistent practice, trial and error, and dedicated education to build knowledge and skills.</p>

			<p>Technology is the same thing. You'll make mistakes, you'll learn how to fix them, and you'll get better at it. </p>

			<p>Stay focused, draw on the wealth of available resources, and practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>
