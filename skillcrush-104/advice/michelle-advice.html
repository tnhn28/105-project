			<h4>Practice and review your notes!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning to program, you will find that you are recieving a lot of
			new information all at once. It seems really interesting and cool to see everything, but it will take
		practice, feedback, and reviewing your notes in order to master things.
	</p>

			<p>Don't view problems as problems, view them as challenges to take on!</p>

<div class="float-right">
			<h4>Dissecting information plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>If you come across information that doesn't seem to totally make sense to you at first, don't panic!
			This is sign that you are actually going to learn something new. In fact, if you review the information that is
		difficult to comprehend, you may come to realize that it will become an expertise for you one day. </p>

			<p></p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
