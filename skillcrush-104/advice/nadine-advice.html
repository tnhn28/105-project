			<h4>It's not too late to learn something new.</h4>
			<p>It would have been easier to stay in healthcare. But five years in, I just knew I was capable of more. With a seven month old sleeping upstairs, I signed up for Skillcrush and never looked back.</p>

			<p>I'm proving to myself that I'm capable of so much more than I even realized. I'm shaping my future and the future of my family.</p>

			<h4>And hey, I can code while breastfeeding!</h4>
			<p>Having a future job with flexibility is my main priority as we grow our family.</p>

			<p>I want to do what I enjoy and have the luxury of seeing my kids grow up, day by day.</p>

			<p>So far I'm loving my courses and was shocked to find out that I already knew way more HTML and css than I'd even realized!</p>
