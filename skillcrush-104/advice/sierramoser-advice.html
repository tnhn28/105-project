			<h4>You don't need a 'tech' background to get started!</h4>
			<p>Don't be scared to try something new! You don't need a background in tech or computers or even design to learn how to code! Take it from me, I have a background in child welfare and office admin for an architecture firm with a Bachelor's of Science in General Studies.</p>

			<p>You just need the will to want to do it. I wanted to learn something new and exciting and that is what brought me here to learn how to code.</p>

			<h4>I'm not saying it isn't scary</h4>
			<p>I will be the first person to tell you that learning something new is scary, but I like a challenge! Some days I resist a little more to start up a new lesson just because I know it will be harder than the previous one, but I do it! </p>

			<p>I push myself to learn difficult things (nothing comes easily to me) and if I can do it then anyone can do it.</p>
