			<h4>There are times to bang your head against the wall, and then there are times to ask for help.</h4>
			<p>As with most things, you learn to code by doing it.</p>

			<p>When you’re first learning, you will benefit from asking questions when you max out your time limit. Once you’ve grinded on something simple for an hour, it’s obvious that critical coding thought habits are still too far out of your wheelhouse for you to be ‘productively stuck.</p>

			<h4>Learning to code doesn’t happen all at once.</h4>
			<p>f you’re really stuck and you just want to explode into a million tiny zeroes and ones, sometimes you just need to give your mind a break. Take a walk, talk with a friend, play a game, work out. Eat something. So many times I’ve taken a break and then come back to see the problem at hand in a totally different light.</p>

			<p>Learning how to code isn’t going to be a constant, continuous accumulation of understanding. It’s going to be an S-curve, with troughs of not really getting it punctuated by massive increases in efficiency.</p>
