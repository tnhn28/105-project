			<h4>Don't get overwhelmed!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming it is so easy to get overwhelemed with not knowing how to do everything.  It is best to always take things one step at a time.</p>

			<p>If you are always looking at the big picture, it can be very easy to get overwhelemed.  Make sure you just relax and do the next task in front of you.</p>

			<h4>Don't let perfectionism stop you!</h4>
			<p>It is easy to let pefectionism get in the way of taking the next step. Letting yourself try new things and fail is a big part of the learning process.  Let learning from your mistakes be part of the fun! </p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Trying new things and not being afraid to fail is the only way you can make progress and change the future!</p>
