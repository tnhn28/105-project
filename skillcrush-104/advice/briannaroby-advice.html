					<h4>Keep Trying!</h4>
					<p>The biggest lesson I've learned so far is to just keep at it. Keep trying. Don't give up. I have been stuck, frustrated and confused more times than I can explain, but I kept pushing for the answer, I kept changing things or searching the internet or asking for help, and eventually I came to the solution and it was the greatest feeling ever! </p>
					<p>Through all of my struggles and confusion, I just kept in mind that there was a solution and someone out there would know how to help me. The more I would practice and work with the code, the more it would get ingrained into my brain, especially when I made mistakes or got stuck.</p>

					<h4>Break it, then fix it.</h4>
					<p>When I first started learning to code, I was so worried about breaking things. I was worried I would mess something up beyond repair and it would be the end of all of my hopes and dreams. Let me tell you, that just isn't the way it works! One of the fun parts of coding is breaking things, then figuring out how to fix them!</p>

					<p>It may sound crazy, but it's just a part of learning how to code.</p>

					<p>The more I would mess things up, the more I would have to really think and figure out how to fix it, and the more I learned in the end. When code came easy to me, or when I just happened to do it right the first time, I was less likely to remember how to do it the next time! But when I messed something up or had to work harder to figure it out, it really stuck out in my brain the next time a similar issue or code came up!</p>
