			<h4>Youtube and Google are your friends!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming cross-reference the topics you learn in Skillcrush against what is out there on YouTube and Google.</p>

			<p>You'll soon find yourself trying to learn everything. At this point, take a deep breath and only concentrate on what you are currently learning.</p>

			<h4>Just do it!</h4>
			<p>Even when it doesn't make sense or doesn't look fancy just do it. You will eventually be able to change things around once you've been through the process a few times. It's better to get started than waiting until everything is perfect.</p>

			<p>Walk away when you don't understand anything or find yourself making mistakes. When you come back, you'll be amazed how it all makes sense or how spelling this correctly makes a lot of difference.</p>

			<p>Before you know it you'll be a master of your own coding universe.</p>
