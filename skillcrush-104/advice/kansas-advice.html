            <h4>Doubt</h4>
            <p>Doubt is debilitating. It is a hard stop and impediment to our progress. We must transcend this emotion. Don't allow
            your negative thoughts to be turned into beliefs about who you are. We are never immediately good at something, everything
            takes practice and work. Doubt is best addressed by focusing in on goals and working towards them each day.</p>

            <h4>Positivity</h4>
            <p>When you become sidelined by negative traps your mind plays on you, try to find a way to immerse yourself in positivity.
              Writing down things you are grateful for, meditating, self reflection, or whatever that means to you.</p>
