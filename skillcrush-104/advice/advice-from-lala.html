			<h2>Give<br>Yourself<br>Breaks</h4>
			<p>If you get stuck and/or uninspired, take a break and come back. It doesn't matter if it's an hour, a week, or even a few months. You will come back with a fresh mind, a new sense of motivation, and things that you didn't understand before will start to make sense. </p>
