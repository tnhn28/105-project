			<h4>Failure is you friend!</h4>
			<p>When I started learning web development I ran into many different problems and I viewed each as a brand new challenge. It is important to fail in order to learn and to increase you knowledge on coding.</p>

			<p>Failure and confusion is a sign that you are actually learning and retaining this complex information.It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Trying out new code that may appear foreign to you is a must!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are about to attempt is completely foreign to you, but you will figure it out piece by piece. That type of perserverence and willingness to learn will help make you a modern web developer in no time.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
