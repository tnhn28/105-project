			<h4>In the words of Nike, Just Do It!</h4>
			<p>As you start programming and learning a new language, you will feel overwhelmed and inadequate. On the days you don't feel like opening your computer becuase confusion awaits, my advice to you is this. JUST DO IT. Start somewhere. Don't let the confustion scare you. </p>

			<p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
