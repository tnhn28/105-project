			<h2>Try Lots of Different Learning Paths</h4>
			<p>If you look at Skillcrush reviews online you will see that some people loved it and others hated it. I think a lot of it comes down to how you learn best. So try some different things and see what you like. The best way to learn is doing something you enjoy. I would say that unless you have lots of money and time, it's probably worth trying out some free programs first.</p>

			<p>Give these a go:</p>

			<ul>
        <li><strong>Free Code Camp</strong> - a great social way of learning, but it can be frustrating in my experience. They teach you the basics and then drop you into the ocean and hope you learn to swim with your assignments!</li>
			  <li><strong>Codeacademy</strong> - very easy to understand, good for beginners, but can get a bit boring. The assignments aren't very practical as they are generally based around coding in a little window, and it's easy to forget what you learn.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then when you're ready to put a bit of money into it and wade a little further into the ocean...</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Udemy</strong> - look for recommendations of good courses in the field you're interested in. These can use great teachers and really help you understand something well if you get the right course. Also if you wait till they're on sale then they're very affordable.</li>
				<li><strong>Code School</strong> - a little bit pricier, but you can start with a free weekend. Get on their e-mail list and they'll let you know when one comes up. Try it out and if you really enjoy it and learn from it then sign up for 6 months to a year and devour it! The great thing about Code School is that there is a real teacher with videos, and the assignments can make you think.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then when you're really ready to dive in, try <strong>Skillcrush!</strong> But maybe you already have since you're reading this :D What I love about Skillcrush is that it is challenging enough to be fun, but not so difficult that it's frustrating. It's also very hands-on and practical! Not much of the coding-in-a-console here. Instead we make our own websites and documents on our OWN computers! It definitely suits my learning style. But as I said - try things out :)</p>
