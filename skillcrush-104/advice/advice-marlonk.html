			<p>There will be plenty of times when the gears start to grind in your head, and you just might want to stop.</p>

			<p>For me personally this happens when I can't figure something out, and catch myself just staring at the code. Suddenly I realize that many minutes have passed by and that I have forgotten that unlike many things in life that you can stare at until the puzzle comes together, coding really needs you to break things down piece by piece.</p>

			<p>As I was saying, you need to break things down piece by piece and one of the easiest ways to do this is with comments. Go through the code you don't understand one line at a time and figure out what each perplexing bit does, and then write a comment explaining it in English (or your language of choice).</p>

			<p>It might sound tedious but what it really is, is easy. You are breaking the code down into the smallest bits so that you can solve it. Usually somewhere in this process it clicks, and your suddenly realize how all the code is working together... other times you don't see it until you have all the comments written out.</p>

			<p>Either way you break the code down into small pieces, and eventually solve it.</p>

			<p>...and you win!!!
