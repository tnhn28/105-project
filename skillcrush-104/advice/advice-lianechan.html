			<h4>Always ask questions when you need help! </h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid to ask questions When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. There's no such thing as a dumb question, and answers are usually always better than having doubts.</p>

			<p>Most people are worried about looking dumb when asking questions, so they keep quiet. Unfortunately, being quiet can be confused with being unintelligent too, but not everyone will want to force out a response or even a question. The best thing is to get the answers you need by asking for them.</p>

			<h4>Understanding how to code is a form of problem solving.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you want to be able to apply this to problems that need solving. Otherwise, what is the point of knowing a language without being able to use it?</p>

			<p>Learning a new technology, and how to apply it to a problem is one of the key ways to becoming a programmer.</p>

			<p>When you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
