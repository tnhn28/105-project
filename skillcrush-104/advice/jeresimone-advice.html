			<h4>See It through</h4>
			<p>When you’re up against a trouble,<br>
			Meet it squarely, face to face;<br>
			Lift your chin and set your shoulders,<br>
			Plant your feet and take a brace.<br>
			When it’s vain to try to dodge it,<br>
			You may fail, but you may conquer,<br>
			See it through!</p>

			<p>Black may be the clouds about you<br>
			And your future may seem grim,<br>
			But don’t let your nerve desert you;<br>
			Keep yourself in fighting trim.<br>
			If the worst is bound to happen,<br>
			Spite of all that you can do,<br>
			Running from it will not save you,<br>
			See it through!</p>

			<p>Even hope may seem but futile,<br>
			When with troubles you’re beset,<br>
			But remember you are facing<br>
			Just what other men have met.<br>
			You may fail, but fall still fighting;<br>
			Don’t give up, whate’er you do;<br>
			Eyes front, head high to the finish.<br>
			See it through!</p>

			<h4>Excuses</h4>
			<p>Excuses are monuments of nothingness that build bridges to nowhere.<br>
				Those that choose to use these tools of incompetence seldom amount to anything.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="advice-three">
			<h4>Invictus</h4>
			<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br>
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
			I thank whatever gods may be<br>
      For my unconquerable soul.</p>

			<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
      I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
			Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

			<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
      Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
			And yet the menace of the years<br>
      Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>

			<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
      How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
			I am the master of my fate,<br>
      I am the captain of my soul.</p>
