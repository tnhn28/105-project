			<h4>Git to Gittin'!</h4>
			<p>Use git as a diary! From the moment you start coding, upload your projects there so you have a nice scrapbook of your progress. That's right, push all your code to git but keep it private.</p>

			<p>When you build a milestone that you're truly proud of, make it public! It can even be a snippet. Over time, you can look at how you've grown and how your code has changed. Later, you can use your git page like a toolbox full of snippets when you need to build something you remember working on in the past.</p>
