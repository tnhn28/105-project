			<h4>You won't know what you are doing and that is fineeeee!</h4>
			<p>At times, you'll feel like you have no idea of what you are actually doing and insecurity will come knocking at your door. Know that this is normal and do not fall in the trap of discouragement. No one was born knowing all details about how to code, to why should you? Do your best, play hard, work hard and if you get stuck, get up from your chair and bretaher some fresh air.</p>

			<p>Sometimes what you need is to disconnect, so that inspiration comes back and to feel again that you got this!</p>

			<h4>Write notes, draw sketches, use those fancy colored pens</h4>
			<p>It will depend very much on the way you learn, but for me it is absolutely necessary to carry a notebook with my notes on what I am learning.</p>

			<p>Some complex concepts or processes can be deconstructed in simpler ways just by writing them down as you understand them. Reading this again sometime shelp you grab the sense of it. Drawing works as well, so sometimes I grab my colored fineliners to replicate a step or image and that helps me remember.</p>

			<h4>Trust the process</h4>
			<p>This is possibly the king of the cliches, but it is actually true. Do not try to accelerate what is meant to be a slow process. Not everyone learns at the same pace, so remove yourself from the "competition" mindset. It is not a race! </p>
			<p>If you need to go two steps back, do it. In the end you´ll move faster and for each step you turn back, you´ll jump 2 steps forward.</p>
