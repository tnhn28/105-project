			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>
                When you start programming, at first when you're following the instructions and tutorials, fell motivated and everything seems so exciting and new every day.
                But there are times when you have to work on a project of your own, and there you are, in front of the blank white page not knowing exactly where to start.
                The point is that probably the road can be hard sometimes, the key is never to give up, keep trying, and the solutions eventually will come.
            </p>
			<h4>Everyday it's a new day</h4>
			<p>Go always for the run, stand up, and always tell yourself: I can do this!
                The first person that has to believe, it's you!</p>
